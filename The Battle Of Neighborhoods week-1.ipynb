    "As a resident of Saudi Arabia, I wish to explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Riyadh based on the postalcode and borough information.. However, unlike New York,and Toronto the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so we need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.<br>\n",
    "For the Riyadh neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Riyadh. We will be required to scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the Toronto dataset.\n",
    "Once the data is in a structured format, we can replicate the analysis that we did to the Toronto City dataset to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Riyadh.\n"
